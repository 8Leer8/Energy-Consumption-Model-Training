# Energy Consumption Prediction System

## Project Overview

The Energy Consumption Prediction System is a web application that uses machine learning to predict building energy consumption based on various environmental and usage factors. The system provides accurate forecasts and insights to help users optimize their energy usage and reduce costs.

## Technical Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Data Science Pipeline**: A machine learning pipeline that processes energy consumption data, trains multiple models, and selects the best performing one for deployment. This pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Web Application**: A Django-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for users to input building parameters, view predictions, and analyze energy consumption patterns.

## Data Science Pipeline

### Dataset

The project uses energy consumption data that includes the following features:

- Month
- Hour of day
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Square footage
- Occupancy
- Energy consumption (target variable)

### Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Removing outliers
- Feature engineering:
  - Creating time-based features
  - Normalizing numerical features
  - Encoding categorical variables

### Model Training

We trained and compared several machine learning models:

- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Linear Regression

Each model was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ² score. The best performing model was selected for deployment in the web application.

## Web Application

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python web framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Database**: SQLite (for development), can be easily migrated to PostgreSQL for production
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication system
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts

### Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, and logout functionality
- **Prediction Form**: Form to collect building and environmental parameters
- **Results Page**: Displays prediction results with confidence intervals
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of energy consumption patterns and model performance
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Application Structure

The Django application follows the standard MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture:

- **Models**: Define the database schema for user profiles and predictions
- **Views**: Handle HTTP requests, process form data, and render templates
- **Templates**: Define the HTML structure and presentation of pages
- **Forms**: Validate and process user input

## Implementation Details

### Models

The application uses two main models:

- **UserProfile**: Stores user information and preferences
- **Prediction**: Records prediction results and input parameters

### Prediction Process

When a user submits the prediction form:

1. The form data is validated and processed
2. The trained machine learning model is loaded and used to make a prediction
3. The prediction result and confidence interval are calculated
4. The user is redirected to the results page

### Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides:

- Total number of predictions made
- Average, median, and maximum consumption values
- Model performance metrics
- Monthly and hourly consumption patterns
- Feature importance analysis
- Latest prediction details

## Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
5. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Improvements**: Implement more advanced models and feature engineering techniques
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to save and compare multiple building profiles
- **More Detailed Analysis**: Provide more specific energy optimization recommendations
- **API Integration**: Connect with weather APIs for real-time environmental data
- **Data Visualization**: Add more interactive charts and visualizations
- **Export Functionality**: Allow users to export reports and predictions

## Conclusion

The Energy Consumption Prediction System demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in energy management. By combining a robust data science pipeline with a user-friendly web interface, the system provides valuable insights to help users understand and optimize their energy consumption patterns.

The project showcases the integration of data science and web development, creating a complete end-to-end solution that delivers real value to users in terms of energy efficiency and cost savings.
